## Credits
This mod is based on modifications to the [Feldfeld Mod](https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/53880-feldmap/) but has been stripped down into a lightweight version.  
It utilizes public mod library files instead of customized versions of Feldmap to ensure compatibility.  
Partial customization is implemented directly in the map generation script to prevent out-of-sync (OOS) errors.
